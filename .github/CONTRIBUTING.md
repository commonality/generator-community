## 1. __Issues__

![Issues][icon-issue-image]

Collaboration starts with Issues. Changes happen through Pull Requests.

* ### 1.1. Create Issues for feature requests and defects.

    _Why:_
    > ‚å¶`generator-community` follows an issue-driven product delivery model.
    > Before any work is done, create an Issue, first. This starts a
    > conversation about features, defects ("bugs"), refactoring, product
    > delivery improvements, etc.

    [Submit a new issue][issues-new-url] or [assign yourself an open issue][issues-url] to begin collaboration.

* ### 1.2. Format titles with **`type(scope): subject`**.

   _Why:_
    > ‚å¶`type` categorizes product changes. Valid types are:
    >
    1. `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies.
    1. `ci`: Changes related to continuous integration, delivery, and deployment tasks.
    1. `docs`: Documentation changes.
    1. `feat`: A new feature.
    1. `fix`: Defect (bug) repair.
    1. `perf`: Performance enhancements.
    1. `refactor`: Source code design improvements that don't affect product behavior.
    1. `style`: Changes involving graphics, typography, etc., as well as source code beautification.
    1. `test`: Tests added to increase code coverage, or corrected due to errors.

* ### 1.3. Fill out the issue template.

    _Why:_
    > ‚å¶It keeps communication consistent and unambiguous.

* ### 1.4. Label the issue (optional).

    _Why:_
    > ‚å¶ We use [`git-labelmaker`][gh-git-labelmaker-url] to categorize Issues (and Pull Requests) consistently. There are four label categories:
    >
    1. `Type`: the "kind" of product change.
    2. `Status`: the state of a change.
    3. `Priority`: the importance and value of a change.
    4. `Points`: the size/complexity of a change.

* ### 1.5. Monitor your issue for questions.

    _Why:_
    > ‚å¶ The team might need more clarification.

* ### 1.6. Your issue will be either accepted for work, or declined.

    _Why:_
    > ‚å¶ It's up to the Product Owner to agree to proposed changes. If they believe your issue add value, the issue will be approved, and we'll
    > ask someone to volunteer to do the work.

    > Otherwise, your issue will be politely declined.


## 2. __Git__

![Git Logo][icon-git-logo-image]

* ### 2.1. __Rules__

  `generator-community` manages contributions with the  [feature-branch-workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#feature-branch-workflow).

  * #### 2.1.1. Makes changes in a topic branch.

    _Why:_
    > ‚å¶ Use an isolated topic branch for parallel product development. Topic branches allow you to submit multiple pull requests without confusion. You can iterate without polluting the master branch with potentially unstable, unfinished code. The `generator-community` team uses:

    > * [Feature-branch-workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#feature-branch-workflow) for small-ish codebases, or
    > * [Gitflow Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow) for large applications and monoliths

  * #### 2.1.2. Branch out from `master`.

      _Why:_
      > ‚å¶ `generator-community` follows the feature-branch-workflow.

  * #### 2.1.3. __*Never*__ push into the `master` branch. __*Always*__ submit a Pull Request.

      _Why:_
      > ‚å¶ It notifies team members whenever changes occur and allows the community to review your changes at any time..

      > It also enables easy peer-review of the code and dedicates forum for discussing the proposed feature.

  * #### 2.1.4. Submit a Pull Request as soon as possible.

      _Why:_
      > ‚å¶ Pull Requests declare work in progress. Frequent pushes to a Pull Request notify your team members about change, and gives them the opportunity to provide feedback more often.

      > Pull Request pushes also trigger automated CI-services, which help you fail fast and assess quality.

  * #### 2.1.5. Rebase your local `master` branch before you ask for PR approvals.

      _Why:_
      > Rebasing will merge in the requested branch (`master` or `develop`) and apply the commits that you have made locally to the top of the history without creating a merge commit (assuming there were no conflicts). This results in a nice and clean history.

  * #### 2.1.6. Resolve rebase conflicts before Pull Request reviews.

      _Why:_
      > ‚å¶ Rebasing will merge in the `master` branch and apply the commits that you have made locally to the top of it.

  * #### 2.1.7. Add reviewers and the label `Status: Needs Review` when the topic branch is ready.
f
      _Why:_
      > ‚å¶ When you add a Reviewer, GitHub (or Bitbucket) notifies teammates that your topic branch meets all Acceptance Criteria and is ready to be merged into `master`.

      > Add the label "Status: Review Needed" formally declares the status of your topic branch, and helps teams filter through issues.

  * #### 2.1.8. Delete local and remote topic branches after merging.

      _Why:_
      > ‚å¶ Topic branches should only exist while work is in-progress. Merged topic branches clutter up your list of branches with dead branches. Topic branch deletion also insures that you only ever merge back into `master`.

  * #### 2.1.9. Protect your `master` branch.

      _Why:_
      > ‚å¶ Branch protection prevents production-ready branches from incorporating unexpected and irreversible changes. Learn more about

      > * [GitHub protected branches](https://help.github.com/articles/about-protected-branches/) and
      > * [Bitbucket protected branches](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucketserver/using-branch-permissions-776639807.html).

* ### 2.2 __Git workflow__

  We use the  [feature-branch-workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#feature-branch-workflow). We _recommend_ [interactive rebasing](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing#the-golden-rule-of-rebasing), too, but that's not required.

  The main steps are as follow:

  * #### 2.2.1. New products: initialize a git repository in the project directory.

    For subsequent features and changes, this step should be ignored.

    ```sh
    cd <product-repo-directory>
    git init
    ```

  * #### 2.2.2. Checkout a new `feat`ure or `fix` branch.

    ```sh
    # For a new feature branch:
    git checkout -b feat/<issueId>-scope-of-change

    # For branches that address defects:
    git checkout -b fix/<issueId>-scope-of-change
    ```

  * #### 2.2.3. Make Changes.

    ```sh
    git add
    git commit -a
    ```

    _Why:_
    > ‚å¶ `git commit -a` will start an editor which lets you separate the subject from the body. Read more about it in *section 1.3*.

  * #### 2.2.4. Sync with remote to get changes you‚Äôve missed.

    ```sh
    git checkout master
    git pull
    ```

    _Why:_
    > ‚å¶ This will give you a chance to deal with conflicts on your machine while rebasing(later) rather than creating a Pull Request that contains conflicts.

  * #### 2.2.5. Update your topic branch with the latest changes from `master` by interactive rebase.

    ```sh
    git checkout <branchname>
    git rebase -i --autosquash master
    ```

    _Why:_
    > ‚å¶ You can use `--autosquash` to squash all your commits to a single commit. Nobody wants many commits for a single feature in develop branch. [Learn more about autosquashing Git commits....][autosquashing-git-commits-url]
  * #### 2.2.6. Resolve conflicts (if any occur), and continue rebase. Otherwise, skip this step.

    [Learn more about resolving conflicts][git-resolve-conflicts-url]....

    ```sh
    git add <file1> <file2> ...
    git rebase --continue
    ```

  * #### 2.2.7. Push your branch with the `-f` flag (if necessary).

    Rebase changes history, so you might need to force changes into the `remote` branch with the `-f` flag. If someone else is working on your branch, use the less destructive `--force-with-lease`.

    ```sh
    git push -f
    ```

    _Why:_
    > ‚å¶ When you do a rebase, you are changing the history on your topic branch. As a result, Git will reject normal `git push`. Instead, you'll need to use the -f or --force flag. [Learn more about `--force-with-lease`....][force-with-lease-url]

  * #### 2.2.8. Submit a Pull Request.

  * #### 2.2.9. Pull request will be accepted, merged and close by a reviewer.

  * #### 2.2.10. Remove your local topic branch if you're done.

    ```sh
    git branch -d <branchname>
    ```

    to remove all branches which are no longer on remote

    ```sh
    git fetch -p && \
      for branch in `git branch -vv | grep ': gone]' | awk '{print $1}'`; \
        do git branch -D $branch; \
      done
    ```


### 2.3. Tell your boss how Git enables collaborative process models

![Leadership](../docs/img/icons8/icon-leadership-filled.png)

  __Git enables collaboration with structured (business) process models.__ Git is a collaboration tool that grants people the opportunity to contribute to software products using simple and consistent process models called workflows.

  > <details>
  > <summary>Toggle a workflow example.</summary><br>
  > <p>‚å¶ Git is a collaboration tool that grants people the opportunity to contribute to software products using simple and consistent process models called _workflows_.
  > <ol>
  > <li>Git __repositories__ store software products, as well as the historical changes to these products.<br><br>
  > <li>Git workflows begin with either __cloning__ or __forking__ a repository, which __pulls__ a duplicate of the entire codebase onto a local computer.<br><br>
  > <li>Contributors then create a local __topic branch__ in which they introduce changes‚Äî-features, fixes, documentation, tests, and design improvements‚Äî-which allows others to develop in parallel.<br><br>
  > <li>Contributors __push__ their topic branch to others (usually another `remote` repository called `origin`) and submit __pull requests (PRs)__ to their announce their changes. __Pull requests are central to almost all Git workflows, since PRs allow Product Owners and their community to review suggested modifications. Product owners can approve or reject PRs at any time.__<br><br>
  > <li>Other contributors answer the request to __pull__ the changes so they can review and test them.<br><br>
  > <li>The changes in the PR are approved.<br><br>
  > <li>The topic branch is either __merged__ or __rebased__ into the the software product.<br><br>
  > <li>The topic branch gets deleted, and (ultimately) its changes are delivered to the world.
  > </ol>
  > </details>

  _Why:_
  > ‚å¶ Git can be intimidating, and The Boss (even if that's you!) needs to know why Git is valuable in *business terms.*

  * #### 2.3.1. Explain that inner and open source are _process models_

    _Why:_
    > ‚å¶ Git is a __collaboration__ tool that grants people the opportunity to contribute to software products using simple and consistent process models called __workflows.__

  * #### 2.3.2. Describe a typical Git workflow in collaborative terms

    _Why:_
    > ‚å¶ Many engineers can discuss Git's _technicalities_, but cannot articulate Git's as an applied _technology_ for collaboration.
